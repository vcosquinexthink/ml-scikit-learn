Intermediate Projects
Model Pipelines:

Learn to use Pipeline for chaining preprocessing and modeling steps.
Example: Scaling → PCA → Model Training.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters.
Imbalanced Datasets:

Work with imbalanced data (e.g., fraud detection) and explore techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
Time Series Analysis:

Use datasets like weather data or stock prices.
Learn about preprocessing time series data and try basic models.
Reproducibility Tips
Notebook to Script: Once a notebook is finalized, convert it to a Python script for easier automation.
Save Metadata: Record model parameters, metrics, and experiment notes.
Version Datasets: Use tools like DVC or keep snapshots in your repository.
Continuous Learning
Keep referring to the scikit-learn User Guide.
Practice with datasets from sources like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
